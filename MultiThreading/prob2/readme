Part 2 : Sleeping stylist with monitor
Name : Dipal Bhandari 
(I did this project alone)

- To run this part , 
gcc monitor.c sleepingStylistMon.c -o sleepingStylistMonitor -lpthread
./sleepingStylistMonitor



- To ensure the program is current , I have created a print statement that prints the num of haircut
and the customer waiting for the line. 

-  I spent around 8 hours for this part 


- This was the most difficult part for me , i would give 4.
